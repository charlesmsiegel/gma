Let's start a session for issue #$ARGUMENTS. Remember to stop and ask me clarifying questions to make sure you understand what needs to be done. Also, be sure to use the designated agents for their jobs. Use @agent-test-automator to write tests that will be passed if the issue is resolved, then use an appropriate implementation agent. Finally, run @agent-simplify to create more manageable code and run @agent-docs-architect to update all documents based on the pull request. Commit frequently on the new branch, whenever any unit of work (test creation, implementation that satisfies a test, etc) is finished.
