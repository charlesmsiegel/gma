"""
Tests for migration compatibility when applying mixins to existing models.

Tests verify that:
1. Field deduplication works correctly without data loss
2. Existing data is preserved during migration
3. Field type changes are handled safely
4. Database constraints are maintained
5. Migration rollback scenarios work correctly
6. Performance is maintained after migration

These tests simulate the migration process and verify that all
mixin applications will work safely in production.
