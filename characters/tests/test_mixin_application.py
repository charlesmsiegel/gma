"""
Tests for applying model mixins to existing Character model.

Tests verify that Character model can successfully apply:
- TimestampedMixin (created_at, updated_at fields) - deduplication test
- NamedModelMixin (name field + __str__ method) - deduplication test
- Enhanced AuditableMixin (created_by, modified_by fields + enhanced save())

These tests ensure:
1. Mixins are properly applied without field conflicts
2. Existing functionality is preserved
3. Enhanced audit system integrates correctly with mixins
4. Field deduplication works correctly during migration
5. No regressions in existing Character functionality
